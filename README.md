# Capstone
Semester 6 capstone project at mohawk college

This project is a CRUD web application created with .net core.

It is a website where users are able to create lists of items in collections and they are able to set the items as watching / reading or complete.

Users are able to select items to go to their respective information pages and on the info pages users are able to create reviews, add / remove the item from their list and able to add or remove it from their favorite series.

There are three different collection types: Anime, Manga and Light Novels.

Each collection type is seperate from the others and users have a personal list of each collection type.

Users have their own profile page where it shows information about what they are watching / reading, what the most recently added items to the three different collections are, the users favorite items from each collection and links to their collection lists and the users reviews.
