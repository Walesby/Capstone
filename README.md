# Capstone
Semester 6 capstone project at mohawk college

This project is a CRUD web application created with .net core.

The website is a website where users are able to create lists of items in collections and they are able to set the items as watching / reading or complete.
Users are able to select items to go to their respective information pages and on the info pages users are able to create reviews, add / remove the item from their list and able to add or remove it from their favorite series.
There are three different collection types: Anime, Manga and Light Novels.
Each collection is seperate from the other and users have a personal list of each collection type.
